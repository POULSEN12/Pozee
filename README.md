2. **Open Your Project:**
   - Open VS Code and navigate to your project folder (`File` > `Open Folder...`).

3. **Create or Open Your Program File:**
   - Open the file containing the code you want to debug (`File` > `Open File...` or through the Explorer view).

4. **Set Breakpoints:**
   - Click in the gutter next to the line numbers in your code editor to set breakpoints. Breakpoints are markers that pause code execution at specific points to examine the programâ€™s state.

5. **Start Debugging:**
   - Open the Debug view in VS Code by clicking on the bug icon in the Activity Bar (or `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
   - Click on the green play button (`Start Debugging`) or press `F5`. This action starts debugging based on the selected debug configuration.

6. **Select a Debug Configuration:**
   - If itâ€™s your first time debugging in the current workspace, you might need to choose or create a debug configuration. VS Code provides default configurations for popular languages and frameworks.
   - To configure or select a debug configuration manually, click on the gear icon next to the play button and choose `Add Configuration...` or edit `launch.json` directly.

7. **Debugging Controls:**
   - Once debugging starts, you can use the following controls in the Debug view:
     - **Continue (`F5`):** Resume program execution until the next breakpoint.
     - **Step Over (`F10`):** Execute the current line of code and move to the next line.
     - **Step Into (`F11`):** Move into the function call on the current line (if applicable).
     - **Step Out (`Shift+F11`):** Continue execution until the current function exits.
     - **Restart (`Ctrl+Shift+F5`):** Stop and restart the debugging session.
     - **Stop (`Shift+F5`):** Terminate the debugging session.

8. **Inspect Variables and Call Stack:**
   - While debugging, you can view the values of variables and objects in the `Variables` pane.
   - Use the `Call Stack` pane to navigate through the call stack and understand the flow of your program.

### Key Debugging Features in VS Code

1. **Inline Debugging:**
   - Hover over variables and expressions in the editor to see their current values during debugging.

2. **Conditional Breakpoints:**
   - Set breakpoints with conditions (e.g., `i === 10`) to control when code execution pauses.

3. **Watch Expressions:**
   - Monitor the value of specific expressions or variables continuously while debugging.

4. **Debug Console:**
   - Access the Debug Console to evaluate expressions, execute commands, and interact with the debugging session dynamically.

5. **Multi-session Debugging:**
   - Debug multiple instances of your application simultaneously using different configurations.

6. **IntelliSense for Debugging:**
   - VS Code provides IntelliSense (code completion) for debugging commands and expressions in the Debug Console.

### Conclusion

By following these steps and leveraging key debugging features in VS Code, developers can effectively diagnose and resolve issues in their codebases. The integrated debugging capabilities enhance productivity and facilitate a smoother development process by providing insights into code behavior and execution flow.

   - Open the Source Control view in VS Code by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar (or `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
   - Click on the `Initialize Repository` button (`+` icon) or use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for `Git: Initialize Repository`.

3. **Select Repository Location:**
   - Choose the folder where you want to initialize the Git repository. This folder will now be under version control.

### Making Commits

1. **Stage Changes:**
   - In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changed files. Click on the `+` icon next to each file or use `Stage All Changes` (`+` button at the top) to stage all changes for the commit.

2. **Commit Changes:**
   - Enter a commit message in the text box above the list of changed files.
   - Click on the checkmark icon (`Commit`) to commit your changes locally.

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. **Linking to a Remote Repository (GitHub):**
   - Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository (if you haven't already).
   - Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Adding Remote:**
   - In VS Code, open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for `Git: Add Remote`.
   - Paste the GitHub repository URL and provide a name for the remote (e.g., `origin`).

3. **Push Changes:**
   - After committing your changes locally, click on the ellipsis (`...`) next to the commit message in the Source Control view.
   - Select `Push` to push your committed changes to the remote repository (GitHub).
   - If prompted, enter your GitHub credentials.

### Additional Git Operations

- **Pulling Changes:** Use `Pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch.
- **Branching:** Create and switch branches directly from VS Code using the `Git: Create Branch` command.
- **Viewing History:** Use the `Show History` button (`clock` icon) in the Source Control view to view commit history.

### Tips

- **Commit Often:** Make frequent commits with clear and descriptive messages to track changes effectively.
- **Branching Strategy:** Utilize branches for feature development or bug fixes and merge them back into the main branch (`master` or `main`) when ready.

### Conclusion

Using Git within VS Code streamlines version control tasks, offering a cohesive environment for managing code changes and collaborating with team members via GitHub or other Git repositories. By following these steps, developers can efficiently manage their project versions, track changes, and ensure code integrity throughout the development process.
